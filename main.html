    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Time complexity</b> refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is as the size of the input data increases.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the size of the input data. For example, an algorithm with space complexity <b>O(n)</b> requires memory that scales linearly with the size of the input.
